Kazakh, also known as Qazaqsha or Kazakhstani, is the official language of Kazakhstan. The Kazakh people have their origins in medieval Turkic and Mongol tribes, with their name likely first appearing in the 15th or 16th centuries. The Kazakhs have been nomads throughout their history, wandering the steppes of northern China and parts of Central Asia, as well as occupying the Uralic Mountains. The founding of the Kazakh Khanate lasting between 1456 and 1465 had great influence on the identity of the collective Kazakh tribes. The Kazakh language is closely related to the Turkic languages Nogai, Kyrgyz, and Karakalpak and, like each of these is agglutinative, employs vowel harmony, and generally freer word order. It is primarily spoken in Kazakhstan, but is a significant minority language in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China (nearly two million speakers) and Bayan-√ñglii Province of Mongolia, and spoken in Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and Germany.\n\nKazakh was spoken by over eight million people as of 1979. Kazakh is an Aralo-Caspian language within the Western Turkic branch of the Altaic language family.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Editing Status":"Exported - WebM","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Mereinur_speaking_Kazakh.webm","IDv2":"Mereinur_20180521_kaz","Languages Used":["Kazakh"],"italki call to action":["Get a free Kazakh lesson with italki: http://promos.italki.com/wikitongues_kaz"],"italki active language":[true],".ID-languages":"kaz","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"No ID","Demographics":["5,290,000 in Kazakhstan (1979 census).
