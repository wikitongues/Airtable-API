A variety of Maghrebi Arabic, Darija is closely related to Tunisian and Algerian, while demonstrating significant influence from Morocco‚Äôs indigenous Berber languages, as well as Spanish and French. Since Modern Standard Arabic and French are Morocco‚Äôs primary written languages, Darija is generally spoken and without a sizeable body of literature.
