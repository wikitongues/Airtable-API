I was born in Bukittinggi, but I grow up in Padang (West Sumatra, Indonesia). What is Minang/Minangkabau? Minangkabau is one of three or two ethnical group (in the world) who still embrace matrilineal culture. That means as Minang people, our genealogy is passing down from mother line, so that the tribe head or usually we called Panghulu is from mother descent. Minang people well known as nomad/settled foreigner who live anywhere. In Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, even Britain, Minang people are exist. They usually work as traders, selling rice (food stall) as you can see everywhere, there are lot of Nasi Padang (Padang ethnic food) restaurant everywhere (mostly in Indonesia big town/city). Some say that Padang restaurant also exist in Japan. That's why lot of people said that Minang people are well known as traders. Besides opening restaurant, cloth trade/tailor, anything possible works will be done by Minang people for living. Minang people have a philosophy: \"Alam takambang jadi guru\" (Nature evolved as teacher). What is that mean? It's mean that anything happens in nature, we can get the lesson from it. For example bamboo with cliff. Bamboo and cliff are tied up together. Bamboo supporting cliff from landslide, and cliff provide soil for bamboo to live. It means in life we should support each other. Minang people also like to tell a story or tale. If you chit-chat with Minang people it will takes all night non stop. That's why the legend story, Tambo (Minang wisdom), or Kaba (Minang literature/poem), rarely recorded in writing. They spread by word of mouth usually by poem accompanied by Saluang (bamboo flute) and Rabab (traditional violin) which will takes all night long. The unique thing in Minang language is we do not have language level as other ethnical group spoke adjusting whom they speak with. The difference only on (subjects) pronouns, for example Ambo (I), used in formal occasion or speaking with older people. But if we speak with friends or in equal position, we use Aden. Also Kamu (You, in formal occasion) can be replaced by Wa'ang (in casual conditions). Or if in formal condition, It's better to call the name.
