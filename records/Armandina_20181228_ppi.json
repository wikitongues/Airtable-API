Paipai was spoken by around 100 people in 2007.

Other Pai languages include the varieties of Upland Yuman spoken by the Yavapai, Walapai, and Havasupai people of western Arizona. Paipai is considered closely related to Upland Yuman and partially intelligible (the degree varies) with one of its dialects, Yavapai, having diverged from the Upland Yuman grouping fairly recently.
