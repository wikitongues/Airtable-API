Yucatec Maya, known simply as 'Maya' to its speakers, is the most widely spoken Mayan language in Mexico, whereas Lacand√≥n is spoken by about 1,000 speakers in a few villages surrounding Selva Lacandona in Chiapas. Whereas Proto-Mayan possessed a strict CVC syllable structure (allowing consonant clusters only across syllable boundaries), many Mayan languages now contain complex consonant clusters due to vowel loss.
