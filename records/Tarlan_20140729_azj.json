North Azerbaijani was spoken by roughly 6,100,000 as of a 2007 census.

The two are sometimes referred to collectively as Azeri Turkic, part of the Turkic branch of the Altaic language family. North Azerbaijani has official status in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan, Russia. North Azerbaijani, like others in the Turkic family, is one of the languages of the world that features vowel harmony, where vowels within words assimilate to, or harmonize with, each other. Azerbaijani vowels harmonize according to roundedness (rounded/unrounded) and backness (front/back). North Azerbaijani's word order is SOV, it possesses a case-marking system with six cases, and contains no articles. The language arises from the Turkic migrations in medieval times across the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, and northern Iran, where it drew great influence from Persian and Arabic.\n\n--\nRaanan Robertson\nhttp://www.Wikitongues.org","Licenses":["rec7FnlQ3HE6p22Md"],".Scheduling":true,"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","IDv2":"Tarlan_20140729_azj","Languages Used":["Azerbaijani, North"],"italki call to action":["Get a free Azerbaijani, North lesson with italki: http://promos.italki.com/wikitongues_azj"],"italki active language":[true],".ID-languages":"azj","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/b6eEK15bgAE","Demographics":["6,100,000 in Azerbaijan (2007 census).
