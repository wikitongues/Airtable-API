Sadri is a Bihari language of the Indo-Aryan subgroup within the Indo-European language family. Sadri is spoken primarily in the Indian states of Jharkhland, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. Sadri is spoken natively by the people of the Chota Nagpur region, and as a lingua franca by many other tribal groups including the Kharia, Munda, Bhumij, and Kurukh.\n\nKharia was spoken by roughly 240,000 people in India as of a 2001 census. As a Kharia-Juang language, Kharia is part of the South Munda group within the Austro-Asiatic language family. Kharia is spoken primarily by the indigenous Kharia people of eastern India. Kharia's closest living relative is Juang, and together they make up the Kharia-Juang branch of the Munda language grouping, but their similarities are distant.\n\nSambalpuri was spoken by roughly 519,000 people as of a 2001 census. Sambalpuri is an Oriya language belonging to the Indo-Aryan group within the Indo-European language family. Also known as Western Odia or Kosali, Sambalpuri is considered by some a dialect of Odia, but more typically by Sambalpuri speakers as a separate language entirely, where standard Odia is spoken in formal settings. A 2006 survey suggested that Sambalpuri and Standard Odia share roughly three quarters of their core vocabulary.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Video Territory":["reca6xWE2xtOo6X6o"],".Scheduling":true,"Editing Status":"Exported - WebM","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Nicolas_speaking_Sadri%2C_Kharia%2C_and_Sambalpuri.webm","IDv2":"Nicolas_20181003_sck+khr+spv","Languages Used":["Sadri","Kharia","Sambalpuri"],"italki active language":[null,null,null],".ID-languages":"sck+khr+spv","Languages per video":3,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/WKxxsUnObj8","Demographics":["3,290,000 in India (2001 census). 2,050,000 Sadani, 1,243,000 Nagpuria.
