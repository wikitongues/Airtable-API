Marwari is spoken in the Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana, and outside India within small communities of Eastern Pakistan and Nepal. Marwari is one of the largest varieties of Rajasthani and contains within it twenty-four dialects, notably Tha·∏∑ƒ´, BƒÅg·πõƒ´, Bhitrauti, Sirohƒ´, and GodwƒÅrƒ´. It is widely written in the Devanagari script, although historically it was written in Mahajani. Marwari has roughly 50-65% lexical similarity with Hindi, however Marwari's retention of many Sanskrit words characteristic of North Indian languages is an aspect that distinguishes it from Hindi, and from other Western Indo-Aryan languages. The Marwari people and language are often conflated with Hindi speakers both by the public and in census data, but are distinct culturally, ethnically, and linguistically. It should be noted that some Marwari have preferred to call themselves Rajasthani, and Marwari literature is taught as Rajasthani in early education. The Marwari people originate from the Marwar Shekhawati Jaipur region of Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nMarwari is spoken by over 5,600,000 people and is a Rajasthani language belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Video Territory":["rectoIeLw3qroivFd"],"Transcript File":[{"id":"attSWOPR9v9deXK9X","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/adcc61174596ea056776af08bfb3c824/369c6d73/AdityaspeakingMarwari.docx","filename":"Aditya speaking Marwari.docx","size":17221,"type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attSWOPR9v9deXK9X-6b16415522f4fbfb-32x32.jpg","width":32,"height":32},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attSWOPR9v9deXK9X-9edef3e526fb9074-247x320.jpg","width":247,"height":320}}}],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Aditya_speaking_Marwari.webm","IDv2":"Aditya_20190210_rwr","Languages Used":["Marwari"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"rwr","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/SuNKWIMUjQo","Demographics":["5,600,000 in India (2007 SIL).
