Bagri is spoken by at least two million people, primarily in the north Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana. An Indo-European language of the Indo-Aryan linguistic family, it is considered by linguists to be a member of the Rajasthani subgroup, bearing close resemblance to several other languages, including Marwari, Malvi, and Mewati. As such, these mother tongues are sometimes described as dialects of a single ‚ÄòRajasthani language‚Äô.
