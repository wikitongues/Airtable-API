So like I said, my name is Owen, I'm sixteen years old and I live in the Isle of Man (alternative name) - that's another name - in the south of the island, in a small rural village called Colby.  So yes, in Colby I think there are about two thousand people: I'm not fully sure about that, but something like it. So in the Isle of Man, we have a national language called Manx, or Manx Gaelic and it's similar to Scottish Gaelic and Irish Gaelic also, and as well as that, it's a little like Welsh Cornish and Breton sometimes.  So, Manx is spoken by around two thousand people. I'm not fully sure about that number but it's around two thousand I think; as well as that number, there are people always wanting and inclined to learn the language in classes and school lessons and in addition, there is a Manx-medium primary school in St John's, in the centre of the Island. I think that about 70 children attend that school, I'm not fully sure but children enough anyway and it's very good in truth, because those kids learn solely through Manx and there is no English spoken at all until their fifth year I believe, but anyway, it's purely Manx that is spoken for the majority of the time. The pupils become fluent in Manx before they're even in the second year of school and that's fantastic because it creates more Manx speakers every year, and the school is perhaps even as old as me; about fifteen years old at the present moment, I'm not fully sure, but every year it becomes more and more popular and well-considered; more parents send their kids to the school because they want their kids to be able to speak Manx; they have a sort of pride and that's wonderful without a shadow of a doubt.  So, the majority of the kids who went to the Bunscoill Gaelgagh (Manx-medium primary school) go to QE2 high school in Peel after attending the Bunscoill Gaelgagh and that's fab because the kids who went to the BG are offered the opportunity to do all their lessons solely through Manx in QE2, and that opportunity isn't given to anyone else in any other schools on the island as far as I'm aware.  There are five secondary schools on the IOM; Castle Rushen High School -the school I go to and that's in the south - and as well as that, there are two schools in Douglas (the capital): St Ninian's and Ballakermeen.  In the north, there is Ramsey Grammar School and, what else? King William's College in the south also.  So, in schools, the opportunity is given to people, well, anyone, to do lessons and a TCG and that's equivalent to a GCSE in Manx and as well as the TCG, an A level is doable and last year, aye, a year ago, I did the TCG and this year I've just finished the A Level and I, in my heart, believe that it's fab because it encourages more people, perhaps, to do Manx as you can get something out of it and say that you're fluent in Manx if you have a TCG or A Level and that's good above measure.  So Manx is growing, more people and more kids are learning the language, more parents are sending their kids to the Bunscoill Gaelgagh and perhaps the best thing, there are lots of native speakers - well, maybe not lots but enough, you know? Native speakers enough and lots of parents use Manx within the household and subsequently kids grow up through Manx; they're born and bred through the language.  So Manx is alive and strong and it will be like that forever I hope.","Publicity Clause":true,"Raw Thumbnail":[{"id":"attMTVbwSmrLcCR1h","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/EtYxFgmxSKioix8pU2vd_Screen%20Shot%202018-02-26%20at%206.00.49%20PM.png","filename":"Screen Shot 2018-02-26 at 6.00.49 PM.png","size":2168313,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/EBQJ5qKGRCq5TQf0JwKu_small_Screen%20Shot%202018-02-26%20at%206.00.49%20PM.png","width":58,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/W5ELI5i6SoKL2q0HNVug_large_Screen%20Shot%202018-02-26%20at%206.00.49%20PM.png","width":830,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/cRwO8NetQxWw8PbCcERm_full_Screen%20Shot%202018-02-26%20at%206.00.49%20PM.png","width":2372,"height":1464}}}],"Youtube Publish Schedule":"2018-02-26","Branded Thumbnail":[{"id":"att8sIpv4raB2dzkZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/8qITwasbQ3aIA7lBp0IQ_Owen_20170803_glv.jpg","filename":"Owen_20170803_glv.jpg","size":201497,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"Youtube ID":"mNyEuC2GxGk","Speakers":["recr5USB0mcdDgEUx"],"Video Description":"This video was recorded in Colby, Isle of Man, the United Kingdom.
