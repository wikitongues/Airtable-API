I had told him that the recording was for Wikitongues and I was doing it as a volunteer. I showed him the home page of the Wikitongues website and played one of the videos. I did not expect him to name my workplace in the video. I spoke with him about this after I had stopped recording the video and he has agreed to us editing out the bit where he names my workplace. In light of the political situation in Manipur and the work my organisation is doing there, I do not wish that my workplace be named in the video.\n\n*At the end of the first video, Donyashel says \"thank you\" because of which I stopped recording. Then he told me he was not finished speaking, so I started another recording. Could we add the second video at the end of the first?\n\n*He shows some photos during the recording, which have gone out of focus because the camera was set to focus on Donyashel. I have gotten scanned copies of the photos just in case we could do something. I will send those to you separately.\n\n*Donyashel has agreed to do the transcription and translation into English. He says he will turn in both in January 2019. I will follow up with him about this.\n\n*Please tell me if the background noise is tolerable. Donyashel's home is near a busy highway and the only opportunity I got to record him was at this location.\n\n* I am trying to get someone in Imphal to record a video in the Meiteilon language.
