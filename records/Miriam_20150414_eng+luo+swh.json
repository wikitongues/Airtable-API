My name is Miriam Adhiambo Oduor, the daughter of Daniel, er, the daughter of (corrects mistake) James Oduor Ndhoya [who is] the son of Daniel Ndhoya Ogula. Er, I am going to express myself in three languages which I have actually learnt since I was a child. But I did learn some more but I, kind of, I haven‚Äôt spoken them, so, I have lost some of them. But I still am holding [onto] three languages. Currently I am a student at University of Sussex, I am studying Mathematics. I went back to study when I was quite advanced in age, but I am glad that I‚Äôve managed to finish it. I also have a daughter who is, um, nineteen years old, and she is also at University. I‚Äôve been staying in England for now about twenty years of age, er, (corrects mistake) ‚Äìtwenty years- and it‚Äôs been wonderful, and I am grateful to that- to God for that. I am completing my studies this year and I‚Äôll be graduating as a Mathematician, which is something I am very, extremely grateful about- in June this year.

[00:03:00] Nina shikuru mungu sana [kwamana] ame nisaidia kufika izivitu nimesafanya maishalangu. Nilizaliwa Kenya nanimesa ishi hapa, um, uwengereza, um, kwamiaka, um, ishirini. Vile nilisema nikona kijana, mschana anaitwa Grace yeye pia ako university anasoma natuna ishi pamoja. Niko na wandugu na wadada bado wanaishi Kenya. Nao wandugu zangu tuna ongea kilasiku wananipenda nami pia nimewapenda. Nina [stuttering] ongea kwaizi lugha ninataka [stuttering again] kwambia kusoma lugha sikitu raishi watuwengine wanasema unaweza kujifunza malugha hivyo hivyo haraka haraka lakini watu wengine ngumu kusoma hivyo. Hata unasikia sasa nimeanza kusahau Swahili nanilizaliwa nikiongea Swahili. Watu a Kenya hawa jui Swahili sana kama watu a Tanzania lakini nilesoma kidogo Swahili na nilijifunza kuongea kwanzia mtoto ndiyo ninaweza kuongea lakini lugha inaweza kwa gumu kujifunza. Ukitaka kujifunza lugha nikitu unajiwekea bidi. Saingine unaweza kusikia ‚Äìkusikiza- watu wa kiongea ama kutumia vitu kama makaratasi ama newspapers kusoma makaratasi, um, nakusoma vitabu na kukuwa nawatu pamoja nakuongea nao lugha kilasiku. Kwamana mimi sionge na mtoto yangu kilasiku Swahili sasa inakuwa ngumu kwongea Swahili. Sahile nimepata muda kwongea Swahili nikama nime pigasimu nina ongea na mandugu na madada wangu lakini maranyingi tuna ongeanga kingereza sasa nikitu ngumu sana kwongea. Na nikifanya makosa kwaizi vileninaongea uniachiye kwamana nime sa sahau, maneno nyingi kwa Swahili. Um, nimetaka tu kwawambia a watu wanajifunza Swahili ama wanajifunza ma lugha kuweka tu bidi usikuwe na uwoga, usisikie vibaya ukiongea na unajaribu na unawongea si vile ulikua unaitaka unajifunza lakini maneno ahitoki vile unahitaji sasa nihivyo tu. Vile [nina]ongea unaweza kujuwa saizi unaweza kusikia saizi nina- (corrects mistake) siongei vizuri Swahili, kwamana sijakuwa niki ongea kilamara. Hivyo ndivyo kichwa imeanza kusahau maneno nyingi. So- (in English), hivyo tu ndiyo nilikwa nataka kusema. Mungu wabariki sana wa watu wanasikiza ama wata tumia muda kukaa chini na kusikiza vile nimasema Mungu wabariki sana. Hasanteni.","Translation":"[00:01:17] I am Miriam Adhiambo the daughter of Oduor Ndhoya, son of Ndhoya Ogula. I was born in Kenya, and I grew up in Kenya. I have brothers and sisters and they live in Kenya. I have been living here in England for twenty years. I have a daughter called Grace, she is also in education, and she is nineteen years old. My reason for speaking [today], is to tell my fellow sisters or mothers [of my age], not to be afraid to go back into education. Most people say that when you are so advanced in age, you shouldn‚Äôt go back to school. You should stay at home doing housework. You should be looking after children, grandchildren, and things like that. But education is good because it strengthens the mind and provides you with knowledge you never knew you could have. I returned to education when I was much older, and I thought everyone would laugh at me. It was very difficult being in class with young people, much younger than me, you know? And people laughed at me a lot, but I persevered with my education for these many years. Now I have reached the end of my studies and I will be graduating this July. Something that has been quite important to me is that God has helped me achieve my education and I am extremely grateful to Him for that, now that I have become a Mathematician. [00:03:00] I am very thankful to God because he has helped me achieve all the things I have done in my life. I was born in Kenya and I have now lived in England for about twenty years. As I said before, I have a teenage daughter who is called Grace, and she is also at university in education. We live together. I have brothers and sisters who live in Kenya, they are very friendly. I speak to my brothers and sisters every day, they love me so much and I love them too. I just wanted to say that learning a language is not very easy, a lot of people say that learning a language is something simple, ‚Äòjust like that‚Äô, and that you can learn a language quite quickly, but some people find it difficult to learn like that. Even now you can hear that I have started forgetting Swahili, even though I was born speaking Swahili. A lot of Kenyans don‚Äôt speak very good Swahili, compared to Tanzanians, but I learned a little Swahili and I taught myself to speak it, from a young child: that is why I can still speak Swahili. But a language can be very hard to learn. If you want to learn a language, you must put in a lot of effort. Perhaps you could listen to people speaking, or you could use things like newspapers; reading newspapers or books, or just being with people who speak that language and speaking all the time. Because I don‚Äôt speak with my child every day, it has become very difficult for me to speak Swahili. The only time I get to speak Swahili, is when I am making phone calls to my family, speaking to my brothers and sisters in Kenya- but most of the time, we speak English, so now it has become difficult to speak. I just want to tell everyone who is trying to learn Swahili, or other languages, to have perseverance- don‚Äôt be afraid if you speak the language incorrectly- if you‚Äôre trying or learning to speak, but you don‚Äôt speak the way you want to and the words don‚Äôt come out as you‚Äôd like. From the way I am speaking, you can see that I am not speaking Swahili correctly either, because I have not been speaking it every day. That is because I have forgotten many words. So, that is all I wanted to say. God bless you all those who have taken their time to sit down to listen to what I‚Äôve said, thank you very much. Thank you all.
