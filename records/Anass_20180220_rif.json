The reason is that conditions are difficult here (with the blockade). Cuba is a communist country. Communism is a political ideology. Nowadays, there aren‚Äôt many communist countries in the world. There is North Korea, China, and of course Cuba. In communism there are both advantages and disadvantages. Anyway, it is an ideology like others. I came here with some friends for vacation, and we enjoy it very much. People are very nice and so is the weather. Everything is great. When you come here, new ideas enter to your brain (you are obliged to use your brain and relate). I suggest to everybody, if you have the opportunity, to come and visit here. Cuba is a different country, different than any other country in the world, and will give you a unique experience.

Tarifit, also known as Riffian Berber, was spoken by 1,270,000 people in Morocco as of 2004 and is a Zenati Northern Berber language belonging to the Afro-Asiatic family. Tarifit has several sub-dialects including Al Hoceima (West-Riffian), Nador (Central-Riffian), Berkan (East-Riffian), and these are spoken by local clans within the Rif region, a mountainous area in Northern Morocco. A few dialects are spoken in western Algeria as well. Tarifit has several unique phonetic features that distinguish it from other Berber languages. It has been written with many systems in the past, including the Arabic script which is no longer used by Tarifit speakers today. As of 2003, the Tifinagh writing system became the official system of Morocco and therefore a common script of Tarifit. However, the Berber Latin alphabet remains an important, albeit unofficial script used both online and in most publications.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Captions by ISO Code":["recfoPadefGwwexHT","recJvLEJHeWYVoAzB","recJYjm4GOIV6thhs"],"Caption File Link":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ke1zsmmgmczvvxe/AAD-PbGpXeYqE2kwqgOhE7VPa?dl=0","Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Anass_speaking_Tarifit.webm","IDv2":"Anass_20180220_rif","Languages Used":["Tarifit"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"rif","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/rF7X9yCZTl8","Demographics":["1,270,000 in Morocco (2004 census).
