I am from the Island of Hatohobei (Tobi), one of the Southwest Islands of Palau. The Southwest Islands of Palau include Sonsorol, Pulo Anna, Merir, Hatohobei (Tobi) and Hotsarihie (Hellen Reef). The current population of Tobi is approximately 300 people strong. And about 30 people currently are living on Tobi. Tobi has no hospital because of how small the island is; however, it has a dispensary nurse that supplies basic medicinal needs and medical treatments. I was born in Palau but raised on Tobi. During my childhood, I attended elementary school in Tobi, from first grade to eight grades, but then moved to Palau mainland where I attended high school at Palau High School. Most people from Tobi move to Palau for work and for higher education. When Tobians move to Palau, most of them and many particularly live in a village of Koror called Echang. The village is known as Hapasang to the Southwest Islanders. Hapasang is where all the other Southwest Islands people of Sonsorol, Pulo Anna, Merir and Tobi live. However, there are also other Tobians who live throughout other States in Palau. There are Tobians who live in Airai, Ngiwal, Ngarchelong, and Kayangel. Some have migrated outside of Palau to the neighboring Island of Guam, Saipan and the US mainland. In comparison to Palau, Tobians speak a completely different language. Tobian language is more similar to that of the Yapese Outer Islands of Woleai and Ulithi. Because of the strong similarity in languages with the outer islands of Yap, I am able to understand conversations between people from those islands. Not only Tobians can understand these languages, they are just as fluent in the Palauan language as well. Overtime, as more Southwest Islanders cohabitate in the village of Echang or Hapasang, the dialect spoken today between these communities of Tobi, Sonsorol, Pulo Anna, Merir, and Palau begins to form its own language and dialect. Despite the differences in language between Tobi and Palau, different regions of Palau also have different ways of talking as well. Throughout the island of Palau from Babeldaob to Youeldaob, the term ‚ÄúREBOTEL‚Äù which means ‚Äúapple‚Äù is said differently in Peleliu as well as in Airai and Ngarrard. Culturally, Tobi also has similar practices as to that of Palau. For example, the ‚ÄúNgasech‚Äù, or the Palauan woman‚Äôs first childbirth ceremony is celebrated publicly in Palau. Whereas, Tobi also practices ‚ÄúNgasech‚Äù, but traditionally first childbirth ceremony is only with women present. The first childbirth ceremony has grown over time and the people of Tobi as well as the Southwest Islands living in the village of Hapasang do ‚ÄúNgasech‚Äù, and is now widely celebrated among both men and women present. Friends of Tobi Island (FOTI) is a website created by Dr. Black a retired Professor of Anthropology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. He and his wife Barbra now resides in Hilo, Hawaii. Dr. Black did his field study on Tobi in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dr. Black‚Äôs work and stories about the people of Tobi can be found on the FOTI website at http://www.friendsoftobi.org/ Dr. Black‚Äôs recent work is on documentation of Tobian language and the hopes to preserve Tobian language from being vanished. Dr. Black still visits Tobi from time to time continuing his work on the people of Tobi. He continues to remain very close friends with the people of Hatohobei.","Youtube Publish Schedule":"2019-03-30","Youtube ID":"VCxeM27OAlQ","Speakers":["recjO5iUJxng6nek2"],"Video Description":"This video was recorded by Connie Ngirchemat in Palau.
