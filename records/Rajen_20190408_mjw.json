Karbi is spoken by the Karbi people of northeastern India and north-eastern Bangladesh. The Karbi people largely call themselves 'Karbi' but sometimes prefer 'Arleng'.

The Karbi community is so closely situated with Assamese that some Karbis speak Assamese as their mother tongue, and many loanwords from Assamese exist in the Karbi language. The two languages are not genetically linked however--Karbi is a Sino-Tibetan langauge, whereas Assamese belongs on the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.
