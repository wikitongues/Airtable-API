Hakka was spoken by 25,700,000 speakers as of 1984. Hakka, also known as Kejia, is spoken natively by the Hakka people of southern China, Taiwan, and in several diaspora communities around the world, and is a variety of Chinese within the Sino-Tibetan language family. The Hakka people are believed to descend from those migrating out of the Henan and Shaanxi provinces around early fifth century CE. Hakka bears several features characteristic of older forms of Chinese that have since been lost in modern Mandarin, such as final consonants -p, -t, and -k. Like Mandarin, Hakka is a tonal language, with many of its dialects possessing a six tone system, although some have five (Changting) or even seven (Haifeng and Lufeng) tones. Taiwanese Hakka has two main dialects: Sixian and Hailu (or Haifeng).
