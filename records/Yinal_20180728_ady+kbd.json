I am a Shapsug. I can speak Shapsug fluently, but I went to the village of ______ and learned how to speak some Shapsug there.\n\nBzhedug Dialect\nThe Shapsug, Abzakh, and Bzhedug in Jordan all speak Bzhedug.

That's why we all speak the Bzhedug language.\n\nAbzakh Dialect\nThe old men, all the elders of the village \"Rehaniya\" speak Abzakh and there is where I learned the language during my visit as a guest. I would like to tell them all thank you for that.\n\nKarbadian Homeland Dialect\nI learned Karbadian in the Circassian school here. And the Cirassian Karbadian that we learned in school is exactly like the dialect in Nalchik in the homeland where the words end in \"ish\" and not with \"s\".\n\nKarbadian Diaspora Dialect\nThe Karbadians in the diaspora speak a dialect that doesn't exactly match the one in Nalchik where the words end in \"s\" and not \"ish\".
