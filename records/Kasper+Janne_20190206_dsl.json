The presence of French signs in DSL may be due to their incorporation by Peter Atke Castberg when he founded the first deaf school in Denmark in 1807. The relationship between Norwegian Sign Language and DSL is unsettled--many consider NSL a descendant of DSL (and therefore a branch of the Danish Sign Language family), but the similarities may also be due to a mixing of DSL and indigenous signs in Norway. Despite the early education available for the deaf Danish population in the 1800s, rights for deaf education and adequate schooling in Denmark have a complicated history.
