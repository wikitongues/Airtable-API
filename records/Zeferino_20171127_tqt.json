The family is highly agglutinative and polysynthetic, lacks noun case marking and prepositions, and makes use of a complex system of causatives, applicatives, and prefixes for body parts and parts of objects.","Licenses":["rec415gU0b0pymq5V"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","IDv2":"Zeferino_20171127_tqt","Languages Used":["Totonac, Ozumatl치n"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"tqt","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/cAyhRppr5QM","Demographics":["1,610 (2000 census), decreasing."],"Language Continent":["recrb3GtYD8nscmNi"],".speakerNames":"Zeferino",".speakerNamesSanitized":"Zeferino","Record Created At":"2017-11-27","Language Origin":["recGGGJiNGShmketj"],"YouTube License Statement":["This video is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license.
