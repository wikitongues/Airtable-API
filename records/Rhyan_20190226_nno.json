However it's still my native language and I'm proud of it. Also if the video doesn't work for you then e-mail me so I can send the actual file.\n\nI would like to also explain a few features about my American Norwegian dialect spoken in this video:\n\nI am possibly one of only few who are American Norwegians in Indiana as a whole, and possibly the only one who speaks this specific dialect in the US as it developed in isolation apart from the other dialects of Norwegian spoken in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and any other states which held many American Norwegians.\n\nA few notable features are:\n\n1. The loanwords, of course. Evolving in the United States there are bound to be many English loan words such as one used in this video, ‘kas’, which is a loan from English ‘because’, but moreso its casual variety ‘cuz/cus/cause’. You may hear me say ‘kas’ instead of ‘fordi’ in nearly all instances. Another loan from English is ‘because of’, which is ‘kas av’ in my dialect; although this can be considered a semi-calque.\n\n2. Lenition. As you can probably note here, many D’s in between vowels and possibly at the beginnings of words are softened to nearly a voiced ‘th’ sound in English. This is a very common thing in my dialect, however the transition is not complete. Lenition in my dialect may have started a few generations ago noticing how only 1 consonant is fully lenited in the circumstances listed. The letter ‘t’ is slowly becoming a voiceless ‘th’ sound in few instances, possibly not heard in this video.\n\n3. Når/håti. I commonly use both ‘når’ and ‘håti’ to mean ‘when’. I don’t seem to have used ‘håti’ in this video but I do commonly use it otherwise.\n\nAnd some other grammatical changes that I have no idea how they formed that I’ll be looking to, like inversion after ‘kas’.\n\nAnd yes that’s me in the video, I hope you enjoy it! (Also sorry about the poor audio, it wasn’t this bad before it was sent and uploaded, was likely the change in file type)","Languages by ISO Code":["recRsNOt64M77VmZI"],"Intake notes":["Classification"],"Video Nation":["rec7DUYaTqWxRTABZ"],"Public (Youtube)":"Public","Date added":"2019-02-26","Youtube Publish Schedule":"2019-06-21","Speaker Notes":"Norsk, should be NNO ISO code that we don't have as of yet","Speakers":["recXrpagYly0d5aRO"],"Video Description":"This video was recorded by Rhyan Allison in the U.S. state of Indiana,  where he lives.
