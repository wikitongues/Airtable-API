Barwe was spoken by 17,000 people in Mozambique as of 2006. Barwe, also known as Rue or Chibarwe, is a dialect of the Senga-Sena language of the Narrow Bantu group belonging to the Niger-Congo language family and is spoken primarily in the Zambezi valley. Barwe is officially recognized in Zimbabwe. The other dialects of Senga-Sena are Mozambiquean Sena and Malawian Sena which some consider a separate language.

Classification of the Narrow Bantu languages is sometimes troubled by a potential continuum with related South Bantoid languages, but larger splits are drawn between Bantu languages as they differ from proto-Bantu regarding tone--groupings tend to mirror each other in high and low tones. All Bantu languages, including Barwe and Senga-Sena varieties, make extensive use of affixation.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Editing Status":"Exported - WebM","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Cristiano_speaking_Barwe_and_Portuguese.webm","IDv2":"Cristiano_20180917_bwg+por","Languages Used":["Barwe","Portuguese"],"italki call to action":["Get a free Portuguese lesson with italki: http://promos.italki.com/wikitongues_por"],"italki active language":[null,true],".ID-languages":"bwg+por","Languages per video":2,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/pjWd-n1tVeQ","Demographics":["17,000 in Mozambique (2006).","10,000,000 in Portugal (ELDIA 2012).
