Kabyle was spoken by around 5,000,000 in Algeria as of 2012, and approximately 5,586,000 internationally. Kabyle is a northern Berber language belonging to the Afro-Asiatic family and is believed to have split from proto-Berber very early on. Approximately one third of Algerians are Berber speakers, concentrated mostly around Algiers (where it coexists with Algerian Arabic and French), but speakers also reside in pockets of eastern, western, and southern Algeria, and even France and Canada. Ancient Berber used to be written in an alphabet called Tifinagh until the seventh century when Latin became the official administrative language in North Africa. Beginning with Algerian independence in 1962, progress was made in reviving the old Tifinagh script into a new form known as Neo-Tifinagh, which is now an official script of Berber languages in Morocco. However, most Kabyle literature remains in the Latin script. Since the Berber Spring of 1980, the Kabyle people have been leaders in the movement for official recognition of Berber languages in Algeria.","Raw Thumbnail":[{"id":"attjCSyxG4CgTYBQ8","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/gaIZi033TSud7jubB3tC_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-10%20at%202.56.49%20PM.png","filename":"Screen Shot 2018-08-10 at 2.56.49 PM.png","size":2487623,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/68f5X9YzRkZ28SEFdxxq_small_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-10%20at%202.56.49%20PM.png","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/VnLfgd6TTAmJfxlRdyDY_large_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-10%20at%202.56.49%20PM.png","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/i4kzXpsfQqWQx5U8oHBz_full_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-10%20at%202.56.49%20PM.png","width":1728,"height":972}}}],"Youtube Publish Schedule":"2018-08-11","Branded Thumbnail":[{"id":"attlq2eXr0eTnJwDZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/R9KPzE2TKGYGK5PtWmeI_Luz_20171127_shp.jpg","filename":"Luz_20171127_shp.jpg","size":310928,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/SNCxLSQyiWUwB0EGWywA_small_Luz_20171127_shp.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/LAffyOlkSSm2PYVk4fxW_large_Luz_20171127_shp.jpg","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/gBHg677AQCelUuChACIw_full_Luz_20171127_shp.jpg","width":1920,"height":1080}}}],"Youtube ID":"dhRoN1V1rQI","Speakers":["recC7co6KPskk0xQ5"],"Video Description":"This video was recorded in at the Tinkuy  Peru by Daniel Bogre Udell, where he and Luz Franco Ahuanari, a textile artist, were visiting for the Tinkuy textiles festival, organized by the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales de Cusco.
