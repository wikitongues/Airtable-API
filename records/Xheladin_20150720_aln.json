Gheg Albanian, also known simply as Gheg (sometimes written ‚ÄòGeg‚Äô) and by its speakers as ‚Äògegnisht‚Äô, ‚Äògeg√´‚Äô, and ‚Äògeg√´rishtja‚Äô, is spoken by as many as four million people, primarily in the Southern European nation of Kosovo, as well as parts of Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Serbia. A member of the Albanian dialect continuum, Gheg is perhaps  closest to Tosk Albanian, the spoken variety upon which Standard Albanian is based. Despite its prevalence as a spoken language and a notable body of literature, Gheg, along with Tosk and Arb√´resh, remains politically unrecognized throughout the Albanian-speaking world in favor of the literary standard. Speakers of Gheg tend to identify eponymously. As such, it is an example of what sociolinguists call an 'ethnolect'; that is, a language variety associated with a specific cultural or ethnic group.","Licenses":["rec415gU0b0pymq5V"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","IDv2":"Xheladin_20150720_aln","Languages Used":["Albanian, Gheg"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"aln","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/Nop4WnhX-k4","Demographics":["1,630,000 in Serbia.
