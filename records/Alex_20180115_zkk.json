His heritage language, Karankawa, is the traditional language of the Karankawa people, an indigenous North American community originating in what is now southern Texas. Following a series of extended conflicts with Spanish settlers, and later, the Mexican and U.S. governments, the Karankawa community was forced to resettle and eventually disbanded. As a result, the language fell into decline: by 1858, no native speakers remained. Today, in the absence of a federally-recognized tribal government, support for linguistic revitalization remains sparse.
