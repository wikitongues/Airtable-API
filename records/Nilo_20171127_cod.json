Cocama is a Tupian language belonging to the Tup칤-Guaran칤 language family of the Americas. The language is spoken along the banks of the Northeastern lower Ucayali, lower Mara침칩n, and Huallaga rivers, in parts of Brazil and Colombia.

The Latin script is used for most Cocama public and official documents. In 2013, an effort to revitalize Cocama came from residents of Nauta, Loreto Province, Peru, who, in collaboration with Radio Ucamara, produced a rap video in the Kukama-Kukamiria dialect.","Licenses":["rec415gU0b0pymq5V"],"Captions by ISO Code":["recJYjm4GOIV6thhs"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","IDv2":"Nilo_20171127_cod","Languages Used":["Cocama-Cocamilla"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"cod","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/cxiGMkEZvKQ","Demographics":["250 in Peru (Crevels 2007).
