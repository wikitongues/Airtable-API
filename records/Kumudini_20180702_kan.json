After I got married, I started speaking Kannada more because my mother-in-law was from a different Ayyer community, she spoke mostly Kannada and so I did too. I continued to speak Sankethi with my brothers and sisters when I went to visit my parents. I didn't speak very fast, and it was a little difficult. Everyone in Voddarahalli knew the story of Nacaramma and Sankethis, because some of it's been written down by some people. We tended crops and gardens in the countryside after Nacaramma led us from Tamil Nadu. After entering the Kannada-speaking areas, our language (which used to be Tamil) began to mix with Malayalam and Kannada. Anyway, my in-laws worked in the fields growing betel and coconut in Turuvekere. There, I spoke Sankethi with some people who spoke it well. If you go to some other places, like Mattur, they don't speak as much Sankethi, and the Sankethis there are a little different from us.
