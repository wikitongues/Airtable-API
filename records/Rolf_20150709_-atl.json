I have never done a vlog before, but I am going to give it a try. I have always been interested in languages. My father is German and I heard German a lot while I was growing up, but he never taught it to me. So when I left school, I decided to learn German. As for conlangs, before I knew there was such a term, I was very interested in Klingon, and I learned the basics. I learned about the whole conlanging community because of High Valyrian from Game of Thrones. I found it hard to learn, due to the grammar and the lack of resources but I feel that I got good enough to translate some stuff into High Valyrian. Near the end of last year, I created Atlaans because I fell in love with Germanic languages. Now I am trying to use Atlaans more and hopefully get more fluent in it. That is why I am making this vlog. I will make vlogs in the future. Until later!\nMessage: Hi. My friend suggested I submit this video. I am a native english speaker. I am also fluent in german, and have been learning swedish and afrikaans. I love germanic languages, so I decided to make a conlang (constructed language) based on various germanic languages, called Atlaans.","Publicity Clause":true,"Raw Thumbnail":[{"id":"att6rTsia8mlwX5oR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/c6YmFkAjSGOSyDzC8aJz_Screen%20Shot%202015-07-17%20at%207.15.38%20PM.png","filename":"Screen Shot 2015-07-17 at 7.15.38 PM.png","size":222361,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/bxUmRc4nRwuOVbc66GpA_Screen%20Shot%202015-07-17%20at%207.15.38%20PM.png","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/kOOdnzRQeSpc4HWaai2g_Screen%20Shot%202015-07-17%20at%207.15.38%20PM.png","width":256,"height":145}}}],"Youtube Publish Schedule":"2015-07-29","Branded Thumbnail":[{"id":"attMfwsq5UUAd4o4x","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/vefx8XJ0SzOtwhyGZnjx_Rolf_s1_M_20150709_-atl.jpg","filename":"Rolf_s1_M_20150709_-atl.jpg","size":429480,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/9Mxj3NeRwaiIs5De5mnA_small_Rolf_s1_M_20150709_-atl.jpg","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/2UkJjs9UQgKC6UthR3ua_large_Rolf_s1_M_20150709_-atl.jpg","width":512,"height":512}}}],"Youtube Banners Updated":true,"Youtube ID":"9Nl_ttQDYkQ","Speakers":["recSfBEKgf2ExxVaA"],"Given language name":"Atlaans,,,,,","Licenses":["rec415gU0b0pymq5V"],"Captions by ISO Code":["rec9wIebDt1cpIRsb","recfoPadefGwwexHT"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","IDv2":"Rolf_20150709_-atl","Languages Used":["Atlaans"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"-atl","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/9Nl_ttQDYkQ",".speakerNames":"Rolf",".speakerNamesSanitized":"Rolf","Record Created At":"2015-07-17",".self?":1,"YouTube License Statement":["This video is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license.
