The Kurds of North Kurdistan(Turkey) and West Kurdistan(Syria) speak this dialect and the Kurds in South Kurdistan(Iraq) and East Kurdistan(Iran) speak Sorani Kurdish. Well most of them, but there are Kurds that speak Kurmanji there too. I learned the pure language, this language, Kurmanji alone because in Syria -I come from Syria, Rojava(West Kurdistan)- where the Kurdish language was banned. Like you can’t learn in your own language. Erm... now I live in Germany, the city of Cologne. I came here as a refugee, erm… in 2015, erm… yeah. And Kurmanji Kurdish -like what I else have to say- Kurmanji is a very beautiful tongue. I love it so so so much and I wish that it will be no more banned, that every Kurd -or even not Kurd- be able to learn this language, write and speak with it everywhere. This is my wish. Otherwise, I thank everyone, thanks to everyone, who is watching this video and I wish you a happy life.

Northern Kurdish, also known as Kurmanji, is largely spoken in southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, northern Iraq, northern Syria, and the Caucasus and Khorasan regions by the Kurdish people. The Kurds are a stateless group, meaning they do not possess a state of their own and are considered a minority ethnic group within Iran, which explains the wide distribution of the Kurdish language. It is the most spoken form of Kurdish -- the other Kurdish varieties are Sorani, Southern Kurdish, and Laki. Kurmanji itself is incredibly diverse, forming a dialect continuum containing six recognized dialects: Northwestern Kurmanji, Southwestern Kurmanji, Northern Kurmanji, Southern Kurmanji, Southeastern Kurmanji, and Anatolian Kurmanji. The earliest Kurmanji records date back to around the 16th century and include the works of prominent poets like Ahmad Khani. Kurmanji is also the chosen ceremonial language of Yazidis. The Kurdish languages that form the Kurdish continuum are together an official language of Iraq alongside Arabic, a regional language of Iran, and a minority language of Armenia.\n\nNorthern Kurdish was spoken by roughly 20 million people worldwide as of 2009, but that number is thought to be decreasing.
