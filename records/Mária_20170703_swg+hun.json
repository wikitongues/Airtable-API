We woke up at 5 in the morning with your father to go out to the field. He said \"Well look, everyone's still asleep\". *Well, of course.* When we were going he would be wlaking in the front and I would be walking in the back. On the way home I would be walking in front, and he in back. Of course the horses pull faster on the way home... I laughed because he was joking around. He said \"Well,  Pazli (~'old lady', endearing), when we get home you'll cook supper and then we'll head out again to the field when it's not so warm anymore.\" And then he said \"Pazli, plant the onions, you can at least do that even if you can't do the other vegetables\". He would always watch if I was doing it correctly... I said (sarcastically) \"Well I think I can at least manage this, planting the onions\". He then told me to pick the peas, the green beans... We picked to potatoes nicely together. We always did everything together, us two. Do you remember when you came to 'break the corn'? (don't really know how to translate this, it's basically breaking the kernels off the dry cob to be fed to chickens) You did it very nicely. 칐csi (her son) also came, he put it into bags and took it home.\n\nWhen I came here over 51 years ago I didn't have children right away. Your father and I would go out often, I loved that. He told me \"Pazli, dress up nicely\" and then \"You look nice/beaufitul\". Well, I'll be - I said. At the party (shrefront', we were never 'played down'. \"Your father is from a decent family\" said V치vi (her friend). \"Maris (to my grandma), your father-in-law and mother-in-law are some hardworking folks.\"\n\nAl (means grandma, but she's referring to her mother here), would carry the bales of hay on her back, until we got cows and horses. After that she'd take those to field with her. This was good. They (her parents) produced everything themselves, they had three fields, two for grapes, over and down the hill. All the fruit they had...\nI was so used to going to the field. We went together.
