Because I'm Banjarmasin people, I speak Banjarese, which used as everyday language in Banjarmasin. Banjarmasin (people) religion majority here is Islam, even some others also exist. We have two (big) ethnic group here in Banjarmasin: Dayak and Banjar. I'm a mix-blood descent from my Dayak mother and Banjar father, but our everyday language at house is Banjarese. Banjarmasin in Kalimantan Selatan well-known as river (delta) city. But actually not only river, we also have hilly/mountain area here. As Banjarese, we can distinguish between mountain people and river people from the way they walk. First, mountain people, usually from Dayak (ethnic group), they always walk tandem and in-line when they go anywhere such as market. Why is it? It is because they used to walk in mountain footpath. Second, river people, to differentiate them with mountain people, they usually swinging their hands cause they used to paddling boat/canoe. For everyday life, most of Banjarese are (rice) farmers, harverster, and dry-field farmers. There are also some of rubber tappers, chili, tomato, and so on. Rarely who works as fisherman. But recently we have some issues here, such as coal mining, which harm our land. The next problem is crude palm oil (company) plantations, cause they consume huge amount of water from the ground, causing dry soil even outside the plantation. As a result, the crops that farm by people not get enough water to nurture their lands. In here the special and famous dishes here are Ketupat Kandangan (a coconut leaf wrapped steamed rice dish with coconut milk soup, can be served with either chicken or snakehead fish meat), and Soto Banjar (kind of soup). If you going there you must try that two dishes. Moreover if you eat that in floating market (in Muara Kuin, Barito river), on the traditional boat. But you should deal with the tide, cause if you can't handle it, you will vomit. Beside dishes, another famous (place) here is Martapura, the gemstone center, from agate to diamond. Other things that unique here, if in Java (island) they have Batik pattern fabrics, in here we also have pattern fabrics called Sasirangan. That's all the story from me, thank you very much, Assalamualaikum. Wr.
