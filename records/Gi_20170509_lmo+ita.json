Lombard is spoken by nearly four million people, primarily in the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Piedmont, as well as in pockets of Switzerland. A Romance language of the Indo-European family, Lombard emerged in the ninth century CE, and is closely related to languages like Catalan, Occitan, and French, all of which developed from the balkanization of the Latin-speaking world. Of these, it is perhaps most closely related to the Ligurian, Piedmontese, and Emilian-Romagnol languages of Northern Italy. A literary language since at least the 13th century CE, Lombard experienced a decline in speakers towards the end of the 20th century thanks in part to government marginalization.
