My name is Youssef. I am from the City of Alexandria, in Egypt, but I live abroad. The city of Alexandria is a beautiful city of the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The thing I love doing the most when I‚Äôm in Alexandria, is to walk on the Corniche (Esplanade) while eating a cold gelati  (ice-cream). At the moment I am studying Marine and River Science and how we can keep these environments clean from pollution. Also I am learning how we can protect the fishes and other organisms living in Marine and Riverine environments. We do this by taking water samples and then analyzing them in the lab to find out what are the reasons for pollution in the water.
