They basically escaped from Italy to Mexico, because there were harsh conditions in Veneto at that time that made them escape or leave. It was mainly due to the Piave river that overflowed and destroyed lots of farms and homes, so they didn't have anywhere else to live or go and went to Mexico, Chipilo. They lived there and inhabited it even till this day! They have helped immensely in conserve and preserve this language that I am speaking to you in, even if I had never went to Mexico before! But the people/Venetians have always throughout Chipilo's history have preserved and conserved this language, the culture, and traditions! It's such a rare thing, because it was conserved for 100+ years in which people are still learning it, and speaking it till this day! It is something that makes me go \"WOW\". Overall, I don't want to waste your time talking here, but in Chipilo there are currently around 4000-5000 inhabitants who speak the language, and maintain the same traditions like the burning of the witch, or the \"Capo de anno\". But people have also started adopting slowly Mexican traditions such as \"Posadas\", and other things. You can see the documentary made on Youtube, just type in Chipilo, and you can see the history and story of Chipilo of which you can hear all of it! Well that sums it up!
