My name is Joseph Ho (For my personal privacy, I prefer not to show my complete Chinese name). I am about 25 this year. Now I come back to my hometown Sunwui, a place that I was born and grow up here, to record this video. Now I am speaking The Sunwui city's dialect. Actually it is a kind of Cantonese, but different from the standard Cantonese which is spoken by the people from HongKong, Macao and the most part of Canton province. The core vocabulary or grammar of this dialect is very similar to the standard Cantonese, that's why we Sze Yup's people can learn or speak standard Cantonese easily. But the tones of this dialect is quite different from the standard Cantonese. For example, in standard cantonese, there are nine tones (written in the sample Chinese characters and the Cantonese latin characters): 詩(si55/53)史(si35)試(si33)時(si21)市(si23)是(si22)惜(sik55)屑(sip33)食(sik22); the tones of my dialect are: 詩(si23)時(si22)史(si45)市(si11)是(si32)北(bak55)百(bak23)伯(bak11)白(bak31). Sounds heavier than the Standard Cantonese. Some of the words are differnt from the Standard Cantonese, like: Rainy, SC:落雨(lok22 yu33), Sunwui dialect:落水(lok31 sui45);Here & There, SC:呢度(ni55 dou22) 嗰度(go35 dou22), SD:該址(kui11 zi45) 恁址(ning11 zi45); Now & At that time, SC: 宜家(yi55 ga55) 嗰陣(go35 zan35), SD: 該時(kui11 si45) 恁時(ning11 si45); While we Sunwuiese saw something unreasonable, we will curse it like: \"遭瘟(Zou23 Ven23, Means encounter the sickness)!\" or \"鬼整欸佢(gwei45 zing45 e45 kui23, Means the ghost play tricks on that thing)！\"; If you ask \"Have you eat yet?\", the SC is:\"你食咗飯未(nei35 sik22 zo35 faan22 mei22)\", we say:\"你喫矣飯朆啊(nei23 hiak23 e23 foan32 mang11 a22)\"; The plural of Personal Pronouns, in English are: we,you,they; in the standard Cantonese or the Mandarin Chinese, they usually use two characters. Like SC: 我哋(ngo23 dei22)、你哋(nei23 dei22)、佢哋(koei23 dei22),MC: 我們(wo men)、你們(ni men)、他們(ta men).But in my dialect, one character is ok: 卬(ngok11)、若(niak11)、厥(kiak11), maybe most of the Chinese dialects don't speak like that.Yeah, just one character: 卬、若、厥 is okay in my dialect; Happy, SC:開心(hoi55 sam55),SD:心熙(sem23 hei23);Ladder, SC:堂梯(tong21 tai55),SD: 凭企(bang32 kei11); Know, SC:知道(zi55 dou33),SD:知隨(dei23 cui22)... There are so many different words in Sunwui dialect, I cannot record them all in this video. Maybe one day I could found a YouTube channel to teach you guys my mother tongue! Actually what I am speaking is the dialect of the Sunwui's central city. There are many kinds of accent in Sunwui, not include the other Sze Yup cities: Hoisan,Hoiping and Yanping. You could hear different accents while you arrive in another towns of Sunwui. But the Sunwui City's accent could be intercommunicated in the whole Sunwui. That means if you know how to speak the Sunwui city's accent, you could understand what the people live in the non-Sunwui city say. Except the Seechin(Siqian) dialect, we Sunwuiese call it as the \"Local English\", most of us do not understand the Seechin dialect directly. Of course, the Sunwui city's accent has the least differences with the standard Cantonese in all of the Sze Yup Cantonese. If you could speak the standard Cantonese, I hope that you could learn the Sunwui city's accent first and to know our Sze Yup dialect and culture gradually. Sunwui has a very long history, about 1500 years. The most famous event happened in Sunwui is the perish of the Song Dynasty, the emperor and the general jumped into the Ngaimun sea. There's a Chinese poem to mourn that:“厓山之後無中國 (The real China has perished after the war of Sunwui Ngaisan.)” In the Ming Dynasty, we Sunwui have Chan Pak Sha, a famous scholar. In the late Qing Dynasty to ROC, we Sunwui have Leung Kai Chiu, a celebrated political figure. They are all outstanding people of Sunwui. We Sunwuiese, or Sze Yup people love our hometown, even though they leave their hometown and earn a lot of money, they are willing to make contribution to their mothertown. I hope that I could be one of them. I've left Sunwui for many years and cannot come back to Sunwui often, but I always want to do something for my Sunwui, for my mother tongue and make more people in the world to know my dialect! I also wish that we Sunwuiese could exert yourselves constantly. Even though we become a little district of Jiangmen and always be suppressed by Jiangmen. As far as I am conerned, the ccp wants to suppress us on purpose, it did not mean we Sunwuiese are not strong enough. Isn't it? We could be the best one day if we keep trying to fight for our future. Speaking of my Sze Yup, too many things to say and cannot record them all. May I will see you next time!","Publicity Clause":true,"Raw Thumbnail":[{"id":"attYyITyd6AQUZwe5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/iBg7mnNiRfOPrvuA18dd_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-25%20at%2011.02.50%20PM.png","filename":"Screen Shot 2018-08-25 at 11.02.50 PM.png","size":3797790,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/KKICszMARFKOOVlRQS6c_small_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-25%20at%2011.02.50%20PM.png","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/BrZnSiwuRLuI66pgN6F8_large_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-25%20at%2011.02.50%20PM.png","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/415zH28Qwiti2jEz72gF_full_Screen%20Shot%202018-08-25%20at%2011.02.50%20PM.png","width":0,"height":0}}}],"Youtube Publish Schedule":"2018-09-25","Youtube ID":"8OBVOJxBU7E","Speakers":["recx35jY9Piz6Gjbg"],"Video Description":"This video was recorded by Joseph Ho in the city of Sunwui, Guangdong-Province, China, where he was born and raised.
