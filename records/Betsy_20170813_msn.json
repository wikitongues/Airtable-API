Vur√´s is spoken by as many as 2,000 people, primarily on Vanua Lava, where it is one of two primary languages. The other language, Mwesen, shares a high degree of mutually intelligibility with Vur√´s, so much so that the two are often considered dialects of a single V√ºres-Mwesen language. Together, Vur√´s and Mwesen are members of the Austronesian family of languages, relating them to the mother tongues of communities throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Madagascar to Hawaii. Despite an absence of political recognition or native language media, a standard Vur√´s grammar has been published under the guidance of Dr. Catriona Malau, a linguist at Newcastle University.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Betsy_speaking_Vur%C3%ABs.webm","IDv2":"Betsy_20170813_msn","Languages Used":["Vur√´s"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"msn","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/Kxdd3bUVnuI","Demographics":["1,100 (2011 SIL)."],"Language Continent":["recGkOfxYsvAApgym"],".speakerNames":"Betsy",".speakerNamesSanitized":"Betsy","Record Created At":"2017-10-01","Language Origin":["recC8jibB4CmYWL7E"],"YouTube License Statement":["This video is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.
