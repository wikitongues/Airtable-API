It is made of cans. Not nice as this one. It is roughly shaped. The tires are made with plastic caps. When he finished building the toy car, he ties a rope at the head of car and drags it in the alley and on the street. It makes him so happy!\nWhat I remember also about growing in Madagascar is: paper lanterns! On the night of June 25, we put a candle in the paper lantern, we light the candle. Then, the kids in one district are going together on the street, accompanied by their mom or dad while singing aloud \"paper lantern, burn, burn, burn\". And there are actually paper lanterns that are burning. And some kids are crying. If kids are satisfied on June 25, some would still go out with their paper lanterns on the night of June 26.The next time they can be out with their paper lanterns will be the next year.\nPaper lanterns are made of recycled paper. We put lots of colors on them. This one is shaped like a fish. Sometimes, they are shaped like a turkey, or just round.\nWhat I also like about growing up in Madagascar is listening to tales on the radio on Wesdnesday afternoons. My siblings and I would run and sit in front of the radio set so that we can listen to some tales. Sweet memories!\nI cannot listen to tales on the radio anymore because I live overseas. I have brought a tale book with me and I read it instead. The tales are very interesting because they are full of lessons on how ancient Malagasy lived. \nWhen you live overseas, you might be the only Malagasy person who lives in one area. You are not then able to use your Malagasy very often.\nIn order to keep my Malagasy, I read books in Malagasy. I have many favorites but I am going to show you two of them today. The first one is written by E. D. Andriamalala, The City of Dreams (Utopia). I love this book! The other one is written by Pastor Randriamiadanarivo, Grandpa's Coin. This last one describes the transition that the Malagasy people experienced when Madagascar moved from monarchy to French colonization.\nThat sums up my childhood in Madagascar.

Sorabe is an Ajami, meaning an Arabic alphabet applied typically to African languages. Malagasy contains a highly complex system of deixis, words such as English 'these', 'those', and 'there' that refer and depend upon contextual information to be understood.
