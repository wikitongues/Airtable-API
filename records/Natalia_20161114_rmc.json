The country they went to was strange, sunny and hot, and they didn\\&#039;t know its language, but they set up their campsite on a  eautiful green hill near a little town, and they were happy there.\n\nOne day, the woman went into the town to sell some things that her family had made and to buy food for them. After she sold everything, she bought a small pig, telling herself that it would feed the family for several days. Then she put the pig in a sack, and set out to walk back to her camp.\n\nIn the course of an hour, she walked three miles with the heavy sack on her back and became very tired. The day was sunny and hot, so she wanted to sit down for a little while. She put down her sack, and sat down beside a nearby milestone. Because she was so tired and the day was hot, she quickly fell asleep.\n\nWhile she slept, a foreign woman walked up. This woman had a baby, but the baby\\&#039;s father was not her husband, and she felt that the baby put her to shame and hated it.\n\nThe foreign woman took the pig out of the sack, and quietly put the baby inside it. The baby was asleep, and never cried. The woman picked up the pig and walked away -- she was happy that she\\&#039;d got rid of the shameful baby and had also exchanged it for a fine pig.\n\nLater, the Romani woman woke up. She picked up her sack, and started walking once again. The baby slept on inside the sack.\n\nSome hours later, as the sun was setting, the Romani woman arrived at her camp. Her children, who by now were very hungry, saw her, and ran up to her making a lot of noise -- 'Mum, mum, what did you buy? And we\\&#039;re hungry, when can we eat?', they asked.\n\nNow, all this noise woke up the baby, who began to cry. The woman heard it, opened the bag, saw the foreign baby, was astonished, and cried out -- 'Goddess protect us! What\\&#039;s this? A little baby? This is the strangest country -- if the pigs here turn into babies, then what do the babies turn into?'.","Speaker Notes":"Claims to be the last speaker; credible claims of fraudulence were raised","Speakers":["rec2AQmWv55CH2UkJ"],"Top level genealogy per language":"Indo-European","Given language name":"¬ßRomanischal Romani","Licenses":["rec415gU0b0pymq5V"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Ineligible ","üîí Macrolanguages":["recuZwPOTve0Bpgvb"],"IDv2":"Natalia_20161114_rmc","Languages Used":["Romani, Carpathian"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"rmc","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"No ID","Demographics":["40,400 in Czech Republic (2011 census).
