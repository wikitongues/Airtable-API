Amharic is the second most widely spoken Semitic language in the world after Arabic. Amharic is written in Fid√§l, a script based on the Ge'ez system. The first four symbols of Fid√§l can be condensed to the word abugida, which became the linguistic term to describe that writing system more generally. Amharic has been the language of courts, trade, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church since the 12th century, and is the official language of Ethiopia today. The Rastafari consider Amharic a holy language.
