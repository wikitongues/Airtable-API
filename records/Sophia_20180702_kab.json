Kabyle is apart of the Berber- Amazigh languages and is spoken in Algeria and as well in countries where Kabyle speakers are living in such as France.   Translations: Hello everyone, Saha Ramadankoum (Happy Ramadan to you all, in Algerian Darja.) Today I am making a video speaking in Kabyle for \"Wiki Tounges,\" I am talking in modern Kabyle which is a mix of French and Arabic.   My name is Sophia, and I was born in America, and I live in New York. My father \"Avava\" is Kabyle from the region of Tizi Ouzou, and our hometown is from Tizi Rached. My mother is American just like me. I like to speak Kabyle because every summer (ANEVDHOU) I go to Algeria so that I can visit my grandmother and my family. I am studying International and Intercultural communication with a minor in Journalism. I like to address many languages because I live in New York which is a city that is diverse. Not only Kabyle I know how to communicate in, of course, English is the first, I speak Arabic language, I speak French, I speak some Italian and I speak some Greek. Every day I study these languages so I can learn. Thank you so much and Inshallah (god willing) you all like this video, Saha Ramadankoum, and Tanmirth (Thank you), bye.   Thank you Wikitounges for giving me the opportunity to share my knowledge of the Kabyle language, I hope I can encourage others.

Kabyle was spoken by around 5,000,000 in Algeria as of 2012, and approximately 5,586,000 internationally. Kabyle is a northern Berber language belonging to the Afro-Asiatic family and is believed to have split from proto-Berber very early on. Approximately one third of Algerians are Berber speakers, concentrated mostly around Algiers (where it coexists with Algerian Arabic and French), but speakers also reside in pockets of eastern, western, and southern Algeria, and even France and Canada. Ancient Berber used to be written in an alphabet called Tifinagh until the seventh century when Latin became the official administrative language in North Africa. Beginning with Algerian independence in 1962, progress was made in reviving the old Tifinagh script into a new form known as Neo-Tifinagh, which is now an official script of Berber languages in Morocco. However, most Kabyle literature remains in the Latin script. Since the Berber Spring of 1980, the Kabyle people have been leaders in the movement for official recognition of Berber languages in Algeria.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Video Territory":["rec6kJiPMR9FbcuHs"],"Editing Status":"Edited","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Sophia_speaking_Kabyle.webm","IDv2":"Sophia_20180702_kab","Languages Used":["Kabyle"],"italki active language":[null],".ID-languages":"kab","Languages per video":1,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/Ed-KRbXwXsA","Demographics":["5,000,000 in Algeria (2012).
