It is a common misconception that sign languages are literal translations of their spoken counterparts; however, LSI-SI bears no relation to spoken Italian. In fact, it is more grammatically similar with Basque in that verbs fall at the end of sentences. It is one of three sign languages in Switzerland, along with French-Swiss SL and German-Swiss SL.
