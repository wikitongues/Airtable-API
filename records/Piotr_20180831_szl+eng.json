The German speaking population in Sliesia was either evacuated by the German government at the end of World War II, or deported when Poland annexed Silesia. Unfortunately, the status of Silesian and its various dialects as constituting a language entirely separate from Polish or Czech has been intensely politicized, due to the tug-of-war over Silesian land by the Poles, Czechs, and Germans during the 19th and 20th centuries.","Licenses":["recz2qrZbzrYShYjh"],"Editing Status":"Exported - WebM","Wikimedia Status":"Commons","Wiki Commons URL":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WIKITONGUES-_Piotr_speaking_Silesian_and_English.webm","IDv2":"Piotr_20180831_szl+eng","Languages Used":["Silesian","English"],"italki call to action":["Get a free English lesson with italki: http://promos.italki.com/wikitongues_eng"],"italki active language":[null,true],".ID-languages":"szl+eng","Languages per video":2,"Youtube URL":"https://youtu.be/v1WsoWZFZZ4","Demographics":["60,000 (2002 census).","55,600,000 in United Kingdom (ELDIA 2012).
