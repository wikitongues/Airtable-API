Swiss German is spoken by as many as five million people, primarily in the Central European nation of Switzerland, where it remains unrecognized in favor of Standard German. As a result, Swiss German remains without a written standard and is characterized by robust dialectal diversity. A member of the Alemannic group of Germanic languages, Swiss German is most closely related to Swabian, Walser, and the spoken vernaculars of Liechtenstein.
